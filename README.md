## What is it?
EasyLocalize was created to simplify manual translation of macOS and iOS apps. It was made for people, who has little to no coding experience, that are localizing apps, so they can focus just on the process and language stuff, and not on the code styling etc.
## Credits
Application code at this moment was written solely by me, however it uses several open source frameworks:
* Compose for Desktop (Apache-2.0 License) - Copyright 2020-2021 JetBrains s.r.o. and and respective authors and developers.
* JUnit 5 (Eclipse Public License)
## Supported OS
Although it is possible to compile and run the program on Windows and Linux, only macOS 10.14 and newer is supported officially and only macOS artifacts are available to download in binary form.
## Caution
The app is in beta testing stage, however developers will not provide any warranty and are not liable for any claim, damages or other liability. Always save your file during work to prevent possible data loss.
